### How to Update yt-dlp & Libraries (Important!)

#### For Developers / When Building Yourself
Always keep yt-dlp up-to-date:

```bash
# Update yt-dlp to the absolute latest version
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

# Or force reinstall the newest nightly (sometimes needed for very recent fixes)
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/archive/master.zip
```

After updating, simply rebuild the executable:

>yt-dlp releases fixes for YouTube/TikTok/Instagram almost every week. Updating it will instantly restore downloading on sites that temporarily break.
